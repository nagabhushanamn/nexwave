As discussed, please cover the following topics in-depth if not done already.
 
1. Equals/hashCode: The contract between the two. What happens if
  a. hashcode is not implemented
  b. equals is not implemented
  c. hashcode method always returns 10. 
2. Make a class immutable. How to handle mutable attributes like list or date. Using unmodifiableCollection or copy of object. Understand "final" and how it applies to values and references. e.g. a final list object can still be modified using add/remove methods.
3. Design interfaces, classes and services. sample problems : online shopping application, train reservation system. 
4. Implement a producer-consumer queue using wait/notify. 
5. ExecutorService. Use thread pool in problem. E. G. Process a number of files, Web crawler. 
6. Common algorithms and their applications : binary search, merge sort. 
7. Understanding of Volatile variables 
8. Concurrent HashMap - differences with normal hashmat, synchronised hashmap. 
 
Also, please ask everyone to install the following plugins in their Eclipse IDE and understand what they do:
EclEmma for code coverage
FindBugs - Static code analysis.
InfiniTest - Test Driven Development
ObjectAid - Class Diagrams
JaCoCo - Maven build coverage
